VIEW COMPLETED PROJECTS Data Science And Evaluation Population Dynamics and Urbanization in Africa Health and Wellbeing Human Development COMPLETED PROJECT 2013 - 2013 Understanding and Preventing Social Harms and Abuses of Oral HIV Self-testing in Kenya The overall aim of the study is to assess the potential social harms and abuses associated with oral HIV self-testing among male and female adults aged 15-49 years in Kenya. HIV/AIDS remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and youth aged 15-24 years are disproportionately affected by HIV. The majority of those living with HIV/AIDS (69%) as well as the largest proportion of new infections (72%) are in sub- Saharan Africa. The percentage of the general population who are aware of their HIV status is less than 20%, a factor that may be contributing to [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2014 - 2016 The State of Maternal Health and Perceptions Regarding Quality of Maternity Care in Nigeria In 2013, Nigeria was ranked among the world\u2019s poorest performing health systems. According to the 2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Surveillance, maternal mortality ratio in the country stands at 576 deaths per 100,000 births. Nigeria is also the second largest contributor to maternal mortality globally and it\u2019s estimated annual 40,000 pregnancy-related deaths account for about 14 percent of the global total (UNFPA, 2012). The Maternity Care in Nigeria Project seeks to provide up-to-date and evidence-based synthesis of the state of maternal health as well as barriers to quality maternity care in Nigeria;\u00a0 explore\u00a0 strategies and interventions that have been effective [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2016 - 2018 The Role of a Decision-Support Smartphone Application in Enhancing Community Health Volunteers\u2019 Effectiveness to Improve Maternal and Newborn Outcomes in Nairobi, Kenya This study seeks to develop and validate a decision-support algorithm within an m-Health application to improve Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) outcomes in the urban informal settlements within Kamukunji Sub-County in Nairobi. In order to assess the added value of using a CHV decision-support module of mobile partnership for maternal, newborn and child health (mPAMANECH) in reducing prenatal and postnatal maternal complications and newborn deaths, three specific research objectives were identified, namely, feasibility, acceptability and effects of the intervention. The mobile application was developed as an integrated data capture tool with selected CHV reporting tools i.e. MOH 100, MOH 513 [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2013 The Magnitude and Incidence of Unsafe Abortion Around the world, 46 million abortions take place every year. Of these, it is estimated that nearly 22 million are unsafe. In the past decade, more than 500,000 women died from complications of unsafe abortion. Each year, an estimated 47,000 women across the globe die from unsafe abortions. Countless others suffer serious and life-threatening injuries. Approximately 13 per cent of maternal deaths globally are attributed to unsafe abortion. Ninety-five per cent of deaths and other complications related to unsafe abortions occur in developing countries. This study seeks to determine the magnitude of unsafe abortion, incidence of induced abortion, as well [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2014 Sustainable model for cardiovascular health by adjusting lifestyle and treatment with economic perspective in settings of urban poverty (SCALE UP) This is a three year implementation research project that builds on previous observational research in the same study population of adults who are resident in the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The intervention has several components aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk within a continuum of care framework. These components include mass screening of all adults older than 35 years, CVD risk assessment, individual counseling for those with low risk; referral for those with moderate to high risk; and care and treatment at a specially established clinic, with incentives to enhance adherence to the care regime. [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2016 Strengthening Evidence for Programming on Unintended Pregnancy- STEP UP It is estimated that about 40 percent of all pregnancies in developing countries are unintended, that is, not wanted at all, or occurring at a time different than desired. Of these, almost one half result in an abortion, of which about 55 percent (or 21 million per year) are unsafe abortions, leading to an estimated 47,000 deaths per year. To reduce the burden of unintended pregnancy, especially for poor and marginalized women, DFID is supporting the scaling up of access to family planning (FP) and safe abortion (SA) services. The\u00a0Strengthening Evidence for Programming on Unintended Pregnancy\u00a0(STEP UP)\u00a0Research Program Consortium (RPC) [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2016 Strengthening Evidence for Programming on Unintended Pregnancy It is estimated that about 40 percent of all pregnancies in developing countries are unintended, that is, not wanted at all, or occurring at a time different than desired. Of these, almost one half result in an abortion, of which about 55 percent (or 21 million per year) are unsafe abortions, leading to an estimated 47,000 deaths per year. To reduce the burden of unintended pregnancy, especially for poor and marginalized women, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting the scaling up of access to family planning and safe abortion services. Adolescent SRH indicators underscore the importance of [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2019 - 2019 Relevance of Older People to Post 2015 Development in SSA: Establishing Basic Parameters This project generated- through a systematic secondary analysis of (sub-) nationally representative data from Kenya, Nigeria, Namibia and Zambia \u2013 a first body of sound evidence on the scope and patterns of older people\u2019s economic activity, role in smallholder agriculture, intergenerational impacts and age-based inequitable limitations in access to basic services. \u00a0 Project Period 2013 -2014 COMPLETED PROJECT 2017 - 2017 Reducing the Health Equity Gap for Children in Urban Settings: The Case of Nairobi County It is estimated that by 2025, more than half of the populations in developing countries will be living in urban areas. The expansion in economic opportunities and access to critical services in most developing countries is lagging behind population growth and this has resulted in a large poor urban population with poorer health indicators. Despite being proximal to better healthcare services, slum residents exhibit poorer health indicators in comparison to other non-slum communities. Even within slum populations, there are pointers to substantial inequalities in maternal and new-born health services such as immunization, modern contraceptive methods, and emergency obstetric care among [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2013 - 2016 Public Health System Cost of Unsafe Abortion in Kenya The purpose of the study is to analyse the public sector cost of unsafe abortion and explore the constraints providers encounter in offering quality abortion care to women. The study will provide much-needed evidence on the economic rationale for addressing unsafe abortion in Kenya; offer baseline information on the cost implications of unsafe abortions in order to support the development and delivery of innovative interventions in the new legal environment, and support policy engagement and advocacy for legal and policy reforms in Kenya. Unsafe abortion remains a major social and public health issue in Kenya. APHRC\u2019s recent nationwide research on [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2012 - 2016 Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Project (PAMANECH) The rapid urbanization in Kenya at an annual rate of 4% has been characterized by the mushrooming of urban informal settlements in the last two decades. The public healthcare systems have not been able to keep up with this rapid growth thus have not been able to cater for the health needs of those in the informal settlements. Private health facilities have therefore come up to help fill this gap. PAMANECH is a project that aims to strengthen the infrastructure of selected private, not-for-profit health facilities already operating in Viwandani and Korogocho, two such informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. PAMANECH [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2009 - 2013 Measurement, Learning & Evaluation (MLE) for the Urban RH Initiative Family planning is essential to achieving the millennium development goals. While family planning programs had considerable impact on increasing voluntary family planning use and reducing fertility in many parts of the world in the 1970s-1990s, they have received less attention in the global level in recent years even as contraceptive use remains low in much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and parts of South Asia despite high levels of unmet need. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Reproductive Health Strategy aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality and unintended pregnancy in the developing world by increasing access to high-quality, voluntary [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2015 - 2017 Maternal Near-Miss (MNM) Due to Unsafe Abortion in Kenya The World Health Organization (WHO, 2009) defines a maternal near-miss (MNM) as \u201ca woman who nearly died, but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.\u2019\u2019 Data on MNMs can be used to support improvements in maternal care and to improve understanding of the problems and obstacles related to women\u2019s access and use of quality maternal care. The main goal of the study is to quantify the proportion of near misses that is due to unsafe abortion complications in Kenya. \u00a0The proposed study will also qualitatively explore the social and economic implications [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT - 1970 Indicator Development for Surveillance of Urban Emergencies (IDSUE) This is a five year phased research project, implemented in partnership with Concern Worldwide. The project aims to develop and empirically test a set of emergency indicators for an urban slum environment. The project will define indicators of urban emergencies suitable for triggering a humanitarian response. This work will feed into a larger movement in Kenya to identify such indicators as well as fill a critical knowledge and information gap that currently prevents humanitarian actors from effectively and equitably responding to the emergency needs of the urban poor. The first one-year phase of the study was in 2010/2011 in two [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2010 - 2014 INDEPTH Vaccination Project (IVP) \u2013 Infectious and NCD This is a four-year multisite research project being implemented in 6 Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) sites within the INDEPTH network; building on previous vaccine studies done in Guinea Bissau, West Africa. The studies have consistently shown that the main childhood interventions with vaccines and micronutrients used by the international health community have the so-called non-specific effects (NSE), i.e. effects which are not explained by the prevention of the targeted infection or deficiency. These effects are often sex-differential. WHO recommends schedules for delivery of vaccines and micronutrients which are often not followed. Many children receive vaccines out-of-sequence; e.g. BCG [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2019 - 2019 Improving Access to Reproductive Health Services for Adolescent Girls and Young Women This project aims to improve access to reproductive health services for adolescent girls and young women in Kenya by generating evidence on the situation of abortion and post-abortion care and train health care providers to develop skills to offer comprehensive post-abortion care to young women. Objective: Generate and share evidence on the situation of abortion and post-abortion care (including demand for and quality of abortion and post-abortion care services) among young women in Kenya using recent nationally-representative data; Generate and share evidence on the service-delivery barriers to comprehensive abortion and post-abortion care provision to young women and girls in Kenya; [\u2026] LOAD MORE PROJECTS ONGOING   PROJECT Catalyze \u2013 Mental Health: Evidence on catalysts of change for youth mental health in Africa The Catalyze \u2013 Mental Health project will advance a comprehensive evidence-scoping strategy to better understand the mental health and wellbeing drivers and needs of young people in Senegal and Sierra Leone. The project aims to create supportive communities, and foster system-level changes by collating evidence on youth mental health in each country. Context-specific well-being drivers of mental health, perceptions of mental health, predominant mental health and substance use issues, related programs and interventions, policies, key stakeholders, and networks will be identified. The initiative aims to fill the gaps in available evidence related to youth mental health. It will engage key [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Action to empower adolescent mothers in Burkina Faso and Malawi to improve their sexual and reproductive health (PROMOTE) In Burkina Faso and Malawi, as in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, girls\u2019 and women\u2019s health and social and economic well-being are negatively impacted by early childbearing. A vast majority of adolescent girls who get pregnant drop out of school, which results in widening gender inequalities in schooling and economic participation.\u00a0 APHRC together with its partners will implement a randomized controlled trial in Blantyre (Malawi) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) to estimate the incremental effect of three interventions aimed at facilitating adolescent mothers\u2019 (re)entry into school or vocation training. This gender-transformative study aims to generate rigorous evidence that provides insights on [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Global Early Adolescent Study The Global Early Adolescent Study (GEAS) is a multi-country study with the goal of understanding\u00a0the factors in early adolescence that predispose young people to subsequent sexual health risks and conversely that promote healthy sexuality so as to provide the information needed to promote sexual and reproductive wellbeing. The project is being implemented in two phases. Phase 1, which is ongoing, uses a mixed-method approach to develop and test instruments to assess gender norms and sexuality for use among early adolescents. These instruments will be used to explore the ways in which gender norms are related to different domains of sexuality [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Challenging the politics of social exclusion (CPSE) Africa\u2019s young people and women continue to bear a huge burden of disease and death associated with unintended pregnancies and their consequences; harmful cultural practices, sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups. The social and economic costs of such conditions are borne not only by individuals but by communities and societies as a whole. In recognition of this toll African States have made collective commitments to ensure the sexual and reproductive health, and the rights of all of Africa\u2019s young people and women. However, pervasive barriers impede such progress, and profound gaps remain in the translation [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Assessing an effective model of care for survivors of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Dadaab, Kenya In humanitarian and emergency settings, women and girls disproportionately experience high rates of gender-based violence (GBV).\u00a0 As in other settings, physical and sexual violence have short- and long-term negative effects on the survivors\u2019 physical and emotional wellbeing, often lingering beyond the emergency period if not appropriately addressed. In Dadaab-Kenya, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and CARE International, have developed an individual comprehensive case management (ICCM) service delivery model to respond to GBV cases within the refugee camps. These response services are delivered by the IRC and CARE professional staff, with minimal assistance from refugee community workers (RCWs). To date, no [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Evaluation of in their hands program The In Their Hands (ITH) program aims to increase adolescents\u2019 use of high-quality sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services through targeted interventions in Kenya. The project is implemented by three partners: Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK), Well Told Story (WTS) and Triggerise. The evaluation aims to generate evidence on how the ITH partnership model is working to meet the intended goals of the project and the needs of adolescents, assess adolescent service user\u2019s experience and how the programme has influenced adolescent voice, decision-making autonomy, power dynamics and provider accountability.

Strongly grounded in international human rights standards, the SDGs aim for an inclusive world and put economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights and the right to development at the core of social progress. ONGOING   PROJECT The gendered socialization of very young adolescents in schools and sexual and reproductive health Adolescents in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those in low-income urban settlements, are at significant risk for poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. Most interventions aimed at improving adolescent SRH have focused on older adolescents aged 15-19 years, often neglecting very young adolescents aged 10-14 years, whose emerging sexuality can determine future SRH. In this study, we will investigate schools as sites for the gendered socialization of very young adolescents in relation to SRH issues; generate evidence on what works to change norms and advance very young adolescents\u2019 SRH at scale; and facilitate the broader uptake of approaches [\u2026] LOAD MORE PROJECTS COMPLETED PROJECT 2013 - 2013 Understanding and Preventing Social Harms and Abuses of Oral HIV Self-testing in Kenya The overall aim of the study is to assess the potential social harms and abuses associated with oral HIV self-testing among male and female adults aged 15-49 years in Kenya. HIV/AIDS remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and youth aged 15-24 years are disproportionately affected by HIV. The majority of those living with HIV/AIDS (69%) as well as the largest proportion of new infections (72%) are in sub- Saharan Africa. The percentage of the general population who are aware of their HIV status is less than 20%, a factor that may be contributing to [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2014 - 2016 The State of Maternal Health and Perceptions Regarding Quality of Maternity Care in Nigeria In 2013, Nigeria was ranked among the world\u2019s poorest performing health systems.

Each year, an estimated 47,000 women across the globe die from unsafe abortions. Countless others suffer serious and life-threatening injuries. Approximately 13 per cent of maternal deaths globally are attributed to unsafe abortion. Ninety-five per cent of deaths and other complications related to unsafe abortions occur in developing countries. This study seeks to determine the magnitude of unsafe abortion, incidence of induced abortion, as well [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2016 Strengthening Evidence for Programming on Unintended Pregnancy- STEP UP It is estimated that about 40 percent of all pregnancies in developing countries are unintended, that is, not wanted at all, or occurring at a time different than desired. Of these, almost one half result in an abortion, of which about 55 percent (or 21 million per year) are unsafe abortions, leading to an estimated 47,000 deaths per year. To reduce the burden of unintended pregnancy, especially for poor and marginalized women, DFID is supporting the scaling up of access to family planning (FP) and safe abortion (SA) services.

A vast majority of adolescent girls who get pregnant drop out of school, which results in widening gender inequalities in schooling and economic participation.\u00a0 APHRC together with its partners will implement a randomized controlled trial in Blantyre (Malawi) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) to estimate the incremental effect of three interventions aimed at facilitating adolescent mothers\u2019 (re)entry into school or vocation training. This gender-transformative study aims to generate rigorous evidence that provides insights on [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Global Early Adolescent Study The Global Early Adolescent Study (GEAS) is a multi-country study with the goal of understanding\u00a0the factors in early adolescence that predispose young people to subsequent sexual health risks and conversely that promote healthy sexuality so as to provide the information needed to promote sexual and reproductive wellbeing. The project is being implemented in two phases. Phase 1, which is ongoing, uses a mixed-method approach to develop and test instruments to assess gender norms and sexuality for use among early adolescents. These instruments will be used to explore the ways in which gender norms are related to different domains of sexuality [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Challenging the politics of social exclusion (CPSE) Africa\u2019s young people and women continue to bear a huge burden of disease and death associated with unintended pregnancies and their consequences; harmful cultural practices, sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups. The social and economic costs of such conditions are borne not only by individuals but by communities and societies as a whole. In recognition of this toll African States have made collective commitments to ensure the sexual and reproductive health, and the rights of all of Africa\u2019s young people and women. However, pervasive barriers impede such progress, and profound gaps remain in the translation [\u2026] ONGOING   PROJECT Assessing an effective model of care for survivors of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Dadaab, Kenya In humanitarian and emergency settings, women and girls disproportionately experience high rates of gender-based violence (GBV).\u00a0 As in other settings, physical and sexual violence have short- and long-term negative effects on the survivors\u2019 physical and emotional wellbeing, often lingering beyond the emergency period if not appropriately addressed. In Dadaab-Kenya, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and CARE International, have developed an individual comprehensive case management (ICCM) service delivery model to respond to GBV cases within the refugee camps. These response services are delivered by the IRC and CARE professional staff, with minimal assistance from refugee community workers (RCWs).

Strongly grounded in international human rights standards, the SDGs aim for an inclusive world and put economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights and the right to development at the core of social progress. ONGOING   PROJECT The gendered socialization of very young adolescents in schools and sexual and reproductive health Adolescents in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those in low-income urban settlements, are at significant risk for poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. Most interventions aimed at improving adolescent SRH have focused on older adolescents aged 15-19 years, often neglecting very young adolescents aged 10-14 years, whose emerging sexuality can determine future SRH. In this study, we will investigate schools as sites for the gendered socialization of very young adolescents in relation to SRH issues; generate evidence on what works to change norms and advance very young adolescents\u2019 SRH at scale; and facilitate the broader uptake of approaches [\u2026] LOAD MORE PROJECTS COMPLETED PROJECT 2013 - 2013 Understanding and Preventing Social Harms and Abuses of Oral HIV Self-testing in Kenya The overall aim of the study is to assess the potential social harms and abuses associated with oral HIV self-testing among male and female adults aged 15-49 years in Kenya. HIV/AIDS remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and youth aged 15-24 years are disproportionately affected by HIV. The majority of those living with HIV/AIDS (69%) as well as the largest proportion of new infections (72%) are in sub- Saharan Africa. The percentage of the general population who are aware of their HIV status is less than 20%, a factor that may be contributing to [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2014 - 2016 The State of Maternal Health and Perceptions Regarding Quality of Maternity Care in Nigeria In 2013, Nigeria was ranked among the world\u2019s poorest performing health systems. According to the 2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Surveillance, maternal mortality ratio in the country stands at 576 deaths per 100,000 births. Nigeria is also the second largest contributor to maternal mortality globally and it\u2019s estimated annual 40,000 pregnancy-related deaths account for about 14 percent of the global total (UNFPA, 2012).

Of these, it is estimated that nearly 22 million are unsafe. In the past decade, more than 500,000 women died from complications of unsafe abortion. Each year, an estimated 47,000 women across the globe die from unsafe abortions. Countless others suffer serious and life-threatening injuries. Approximately 13 per cent of maternal deaths globally are attributed to unsafe abortion. Ninety-five per cent of deaths and other complications related to unsafe abortions occur in developing countries. This study seeks to determine the magnitude of unsafe abortion, incidence of induced abortion, as well [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2016 Strengthening Evidence for Programming on Unintended Pregnancy- STEP UP It is estimated that about 40 percent of all pregnancies in developing countries are unintended, that is, not wanted at all, or occurring at a time different than desired. Of these, almost one half result in an abortion, of which about 55 percent (or 21 million per year) are unsafe abortions, leading to an estimated 47,000 deaths per year. To reduce the burden of unintended pregnancy, especially for poor and marginalized women, DFID is supporting the scaling up of access to family planning (FP) and safe abortion (SA) services.

The study will provide much-needed evidence on the economic rationale for addressing unsafe abortion in Kenya; offer baseline information on the cost implications of unsafe abortions in order to support the development and delivery of innovative interventions in the new legal environment, and support policy engagement and advocacy for legal and policy reforms in Kenya. Unsafe abortion remains a major social and public health issue in Kenya. APHRC\u2019s recent nationwide research on [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2009 - 2013 Measurement, Learning & Evaluation (MLE) for the Urban RH Initiative Family planning is essential to achieving the millennium development goals. While family planning programs had considerable impact on increasing voluntary family planning use and reducing fertility in many parts of the world in the 1970s-1990s, they have received less attention in the global level in recent years even as contraceptive use remains low in much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and parts of South Asia despite high levels of unmet need. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Reproductive Health Strategy aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality and unintended pregnancy in the developing world by increasing access to high-quality, voluntary [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2015 - 2017 Maternal Near-Miss (MNM) Due to Unsafe Abortion in Kenya The World Health Organization (WHO, 2009) defines a maternal near-miss (MNM) as \u201ca woman who nearly died, but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.\u2019\u2019 Data on MNMs can be used to support improvements in maternal care and to improve understanding of the problems and obstacles related to women\u2019s access and use of quality maternal care. The main goal of the study is to quantify the proportion of near misses that is due to unsafe abortion complications in Kenya. \u00a0The proposed study will also qualitatively explore the social and economic implications [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2019 - 2019 Improving Access to Reproductive Health Services for Adolescent Girls and Young Women This project aims to improve access to reproductive health services for adolescent girls and young women in Kenya by generating evidence on the situation of abortion and post-abortion care and train health care providers to develop skills to offer comprehensive post-abortion care to young women. Objective: Generate and share evidence on the situation of abortion and post-abortion care (including demand for and quality of abortion and post-abortion care services) among young women in Kenya using recent nationally-representative data; Generate and share evidence on the service-delivery barriers to comprehensive abortion and post-abortion care provision to young women and girls in Kenya; [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2011 - 2014 Financial Resource Flows for Population Activities The objective of the Resource Flows project is to monitor progress achieved by donors and developing countries on the fulfillment of the 1) ICPD programme of action (1994), 2) United Nations General Assembly Special Session Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (2001) and 3) relevant Millennium Development Goals (2000). This is done by collecting data and reporting on donor assistance and domestic expenditures for population activities in developing countries.

This includes all programmes, projects and activities that offer family planning commodities and services. The family planning project collects data through a survey whereby financial data on family planning expenditures are collected at project/programme level, covering expenditures during the previous financial year. The method of data collection consists of an email survey to government departments, non-governmental organizations, corporations and insurance companies in the developing regions that have projects offering family planning commodities and [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2017 - 2018 Documentation of Research and Evidence on Gender and Conservation Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa The concept of conservation agriculture (CA) involves three core principles of minimum tillage, permanent organic mulch cover, and nutritive and resilience crop rotations. Conservation agriculture was introduced a decade ago to provide resource-efficient agricultural crop production methods based on an integrated management of soil, water and biological resources, combined with purchased external inputs. As with any adoption packages, the implementation of CA involves a variety of components that may or may not be fully adopted, which then affects its efficiency and longer-term sustainability. In general, CA improves soil fertility and quality and has been widely reported to have far-reaching potential [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2014 - 2017 Assessing the Implementation of Sexuality Education Policies and Curricula in Kenya Making comprehensive sexuality education available for young people is essential for ensuring their sexual and reproductive health and rights. This is particularly essential in low and middle income countries (LMICs) like Kenya where the levels of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual violence among the youth are high. Various initiatives have been taken in Kenya to implement and strengthen sexuality education in the national curriculum, but the situation of teaching sexuality education in schools is poorly understood and faced with a lot of controversies. Previous research indicates that various constraints such as restrictions on what topics can be covered, [\u2026] COMPLETED PROJECT 2013 - 2015 ALPHA HIV Contextual Analysis This is a two and a half-year multi-site study that is being implemented in ten sites, across six countries in Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa), which comprise the ALPHA Network.

OVERVIEW In the stream of work on Education and Technology, we seek to understand how African countries can leverage technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. Education and Youth Empowerment (EYE) \u2013 The perspectives of equity, inclusion, and opportunities are the guiding principles for our work in EYE. Early Childhood Development (ECD) \u2013 Our focus is on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Areas of Focus: I nclusive Quality Education: is focused on understanding how to make education systems responsive to the learning needs of children and youth from diverse backgrounds. This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women\u2019s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others. Youth and Transition to Work: Investigates pathways to the world of work among young people in SSA. This includes addressing issues of positive youth development, youth empowerment and skills development, skills-building and training systems and the future of work, apprenticeship programs for young people, and demand-driven training for the future of work. Education and Technology: Understanding how countries in SSA could leverage education technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children\u2019s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women\u2019s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus\u00a0 on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance\u00a0(AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) \u2013 Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas:\u00a0 Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition, Nutritional Epidemiology, and Food Systems. The Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Nutrition Program aims to inform policies, strategies, and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five, school-going children, and adolescents. Its focus is nutrition in the first 1000 days, including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The Nutritional Epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition, including obesity, in the African context and identify the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies, and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies, and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient, and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to, and consumption of sustainable healthy foods to promote health and well-being while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights-based approach to food systems transformation, focusing on food sovereignty, freedom from hunger, and the right to adequate food, especially for the most vulnerable. We build the capability and agency of grassroots organizations, including women and youth groups, as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) \u2013 The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn, and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH\u2014ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people\u2019s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by researching to understand the drivers of young people\u2019s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities, and those most at risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people\u2019s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful, and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an essential social determinant of young people\u2019s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons\u2014LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit \u2013 The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes,\u00a0chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on \u201cmanagement\u201d signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from \u201ccure\u201d to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment\u00a0Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) \u2013 Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) \u2013 The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country\u2019s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better. Related Projects PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2020  \u2013 2021 Surveillance and Epidemiologic Evaluation of COVID-19 in Kenya (SEECK) The burden of COVID-19 at population level is not known and prevention interventions are not fully supported by evidence. This project seeks to answer the question of: what proportion of the general population has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before? The study is being conducted in the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) area (Korogocho and Viwandani informal settlements) on the outskirts of Nairobi City. Similar studies are being implemented in Kisumu and Kilifi by other research teams within the wider consortium.

Our research endeavors aim to advance understanding of significant population trends in Africa, their ecological interactions, and the implications of climate change for sustainable development. OVERVIEW Our critical areas of work broadly include: Aging and Development: We investigate the dynamics of population aging in Africa, analyzing its impact on well-being, life-course trajectories, transitions to long-term care, and access to essential services for older populations. Our focus extends to adapting societal structures to accommodate demographic shifts, promoting age-friendly environments, and enhancing the socio-economic support systems vital for older populations. Urbanization and Sustainability: PDU explores the broader issues of migration and urbanization in Africa and their implications for developing sustainable and resilient cities. We particularly focus on the growth of informal settlements within Africa\u2019s rapid urbanization context, seeking to generate robust evidence on social determinants of health and well-being to inform policy and action towards addressing unique challenges of slum dwellers, transcending urban poverty to foster inclusive and sustainable urban development. Fertility: Our research emphasizes understanding fertility determinants in Africa, probing why fertility rates remain persistently high in specific contexts, identifying factors contributing to stalled fertility declines, and investigating rapid declines among specific demographic groups.

OVERVIEW Our work in this area leverages advances in platform development to create robust data systems that ensure data are shared, governed, and analyzed with novel methods. The Data Science program leverages internally and externally generated \u201cbig data\u201d to explore patterns and predictions using data science, artificial intelligence tools, and modeling approaches to inform population health. Units and working groups Data Platforms and Systems . The team focuses on creating platforms and systems that support the data value chain. Current and planned platforms include; Data Science and Sharing Platform (DASSA) . This is a data-sharing platform with interfaces that support stories on data sharing, information on legal policies and frameworks for data protection in various African countries, provides modules for data sharing, and collates data from various sources \u2013 including internally generated research datasets at the center. No-Code Machine Learning Platform. This supports codeless machine learning algorithms easily deployed by researchers who are not necessarily data science professionals. The graphical user face allows users to use research datasets uploaded to the platform, and real-time predictive analytics are generated with accompanying interpretations for the user. Data Governance. The data governance team works closely with the data synergy team to develop a data governance framework for APHRC. Additional work includes creating a data governance curriculum on data governance, data anonymization, privacy-preserving technologies, and responsible data use. The Data Science team collaborates with the RRCS to deliver the proposed training. Data Harmonization and FAIR. The team of data documentationists and data scientists create data pipelines for various use cases and support on-premise and cloud-based data analysis through a federated approach. The team uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)\u00a0 Common Data Model \u2013 a standardized data model for health data with internationally recognized vocabularies. The platform harmonizes data generated internally and externally through the Center\u2019s partnership projects across Africa and beyond. In addition, metadata for APHRC research datasets is indexed and made machine searchable using tools such as Schema.org to increase visibility and allow global data sharing. Data Analytics and Evaluation. A team of experienced data scientists, statisticians,s and mathematical modelers support data analytical support for \u201cbig-data\u201d driven projects. The team uses machine learning techniques and new tools like Generative Artificial Intelligence to develop robust outputs that inform decision-making and impact lives through research. INSPIRE Network The Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) is hosted by the Data Science Program. INSPIRE was birthed in 2019 as a Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) network in East Africa. The vision has since changed and now hosts about 20 HDSS sites in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda),\u00a0 Western Africa (Senegal, Burkina Faso), and Southern (Malawi) Africa. The INSPIRE secretariat provides; An annual general meeting to discuss value addition and collaboration among HDSS Period hybrid training in data harmonization for data managers at the respective sites Promotes federated data-sharing models for collaborative and joining analyses Addressed recurrent challenges faced by HDSS e.g. record linkage A platform for joint grant application across the network members Related Projects ONGOING PROJECT 2024  \u2013 2024 The Gates Data System PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2019  \u2013 2022 STRENGTHENING MEASUREMENT AND IMPACT EVALUATION CAPACITY AT APHRC ONGOING PROJECT 2020  \u2013 2021 Sex, Gender and COVID-19 The Sex, Gender and Covid-19 Project is a partnership of Global Health 50/50 (UCL), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC). The project is building the world\u2019s largest database of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19, investigating the roles sex and gender are playing in the outbreak, building the evidence base of what works to tackle gender disparities, and\u00a0advocating for effective gender-responsive approaches to pandemic.

Sustainable policy impact entails transformative change in systems, investments, programs, and behavior. The Center is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture of public engagement. We achieve this by engaging in genuine dialogues with defined local and global communities. Our mission is to inform and influence policy discussions and decision-making by identifying and nurturing champions within and outside government. Our ultimate goal is to stimulate greater interest in evidence-driven policies and programs. OVERVIEW We emphasize strong cross-organizational collaboration with a focus on structured and strategic engagement. We work within key thematic areas, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, food systems, health system strengthening, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), with gender and climate change as cross-cutting themes. While our primary focus is on these signature issues, we are flexible and occasionally collaborate on other significant topics. Our advocacy efforts take a comprehensive approach underpinning our commitment to driving substantial and lasting regional policy changes. It revolves around three strategies: Building partnerships with key policy stakeholders to lead policy changes and provide support in policy processes. Strengthening the capacity of strategic stakeholders within the African policy ecosystem to generate, synthesize, and utilize evidence for improved policy and practice. Promoting evidence-based decision-making through robust relationships, joint evidence projects, evidence co-creation, rapid synthesis, policy analysis, and problem-driven Political Economy Analyses (PEA).

To support myself, I took on various unrelated odd jobs despite my Bachelor of Science in Communication and Public Relations. Nonetheless, my search for a role in my field continued. One morning in February 2023, while browsing through one of the many WhatsApp job groups I had joined, I stumbled upon an internship opportunity at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC).

In Kenya, about four out of ten people die from NCDs such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer, and five out of ten people are being treated for an NCD. In 2022, the Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) highlighted a sharp increase in overweight and obesity rates, particularly among women aged 20\u201329.

While getting into motherhood early in life had not been part of their original plans, it [\u2026] Remote work and maternal mental health: Successes, challenges, and the future 08/10/2024 By  Michelle Mbuthia \u201cWhen a flower doesn\u2019t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\u201d ~Alexander Den Heijer It is 6.30 am when the sun pierces through the curtains to usher in another working day. I am reluctant to leave the bed because I had just slept for 4 hours after getting my child to sleep and finalizing the budget. I drag my body out of bed and sit at the edge of the bed, thinking about my schedule. My eyes are tired and swollen due to a lack of sleep.

UNICEF estimates that 239,446 children in Kenya suffer from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and 2600 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Undernutrition also contributes to almost 35,000 deaths among children less than\u20095\u2009years each year in Kenya (Fanzo et. al 2019). In Nairobi, stunting is at 26.3%, wasting at 6.3%, and underweight13.16%. (Vittoria De Vita et.al. 2019). A study done in Asia and African countries showed low recovery rates from Severe Acute Malnutrition having a lower range [\u2026] Decolonizing Global health: Podcast By  joshua Allan Musumba, Issabelah Mutuku and Michelle Mbuthia Background: Podcasts, as a form of new media, have increasingly become a more engaging form of communication on the African continent. Currently there is a call to overhaul the global health system from its current Global North-first approach to one that recognizes all people as equal, with a right to self-determination. In the realm of research, using podcasts as a tool to decolonize global health holds lots of potential in terms of regional research, visibility and uptake. The Decolonizing Global Health Podcast (DGH Podcast) is a communication approach that seeks to spur interest [\u2026] Examining the uptake, barriers and motivators of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis among adolescent girls and young women in the slums of Nairobi. By  joshua Jane Osindo, Elizabeth Kemigisha, Abdhalah Ziraba Background Sub-Saharan Africa continues to see an increase in new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 years. In 2015, Kenya adopted the use of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) as one of the strategies to prevent HIV transmission among high-risk AGYW.\u00a0 The Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS free, Mentored, and Safe lives/women (DREAMS) initiative, one of the PrEP implementation programs, is providing a comprehensive package of interventions aimed at lowering the risks of HIV acquisition among\u00a0 AGYW in Kenya. Problem statement Since the DREAMS initiative\u2019s inception in 2015, the understanding and use [\u2026] Evaluating the Quality of   Implementation Competency-Based Curriculum in Kenya: Evidence of Effective Lessons By  joshua Brenda Wawire and Elisheba Kiru The national curriculum is a critical component in education systems as it provides the framework and guidelines of the core knowledge in key subject disciplines those students in institutions of basic, secondary, higher, and tertiary education need to learn to become educated citizens and to participate effectively in civic engagement. Since independence, the education sector in Kenya has had several curriculum reforms as the government continually emphasizes improving access and quality of education through a relevant curriculum. The ministry of education is intensifying efforts to increase the competency-based curriculum (CBC) launched in 2017 as the [\u2026] Towards Inclusion for Students with Special Needs: Understanding the Policy and Practice Gap in Kenya By  joshua Elisheba Kiru and Kennedy Kamau The 2009 Special Needs Education (SNE) Policy Framework, the 2010 Constitution of Kenya, and the 2018 Sector Policy for Learners and Trainees with Disabilities articulate a vision for learners with special needs (RoK, 2009). The vision aspires to provide all students with access to education in inclusive environments. Implementation of the SNE policy framework can increase awareness about people with disabilities and ensure that students identified with special needs receive access to a rich curriculum, develop their potential and participate in society. Successful initiatives in Kenya towards providing students with special needs access to quality [\u2026] Improving Social Inclusion and Health Outcomes of Older Persons in Urban Africa By  joshua Razak Gyasi\u00a0 Urbanization and demographic aging are dramatically occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Estimates show that 58% (1.26 billion) of Africans will live in increasingly poor informal urban settings by 2050. Slum areas are characterized by overcrowding, tenure insecurity, food insecurity, and limited access to water/health services. Slum-dwelling older Africans with cumulative disadvantages across the life course are especially vulnerable to these harsh environmental conditions, including social exclusion (SE). Studies have shown that socially excluded older persons are more likely to report physical and mental dysfunction and unmet social care needs, which in turn, may deepen SE. However, these studies [\u2026] Nurturing care for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities: A cross-sectional descriptive study in a rural setting in Kenya By  joshua Silas Onyango, Margaret Nampijja, Nelson Langat & Patricia Wekulo Background: Neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) are a significant cause of poor development in children and a major public health concern in many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Nurturing care has been recommended as a pathway for addressing developmental needs and unlocking the full potential of children with NDDs. However, proper strategies for the provision of appropriate care to children with NDDs are limited in most of these low-resourced settings. Objectives: We seek to establish the prevalence and types of NDDs among children aged 0 \u2013 5 years in the study location. Also, we [\u2026] Re-engineering Resilient Systems for Health to Manage Current and Emerging  Health Challenges By  joshua Introduction: The recent COVID-19 pandemic once again demonstrated to the world why investing in health makes economic sense. Earlier on the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 showed how investing in vertical health programs without strengthening systems for health was counterproductive. By the time the epidemic was ending, most of the gains in maternal and child health, malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV had been wiped out. The world is now grappling with unprecedented health challenges and their risk factors abound. While infectious diseases- new and old, cause a high burden of morbidity and mortality, the emergency [\u2026] Transformative Food Systems Solutions to End Hunger and Promote Human and Planetary Health in Nairobi and Other African Cities By  joshua Elizabeth Kimani The world population is hungry and unhealthy, and our environment is degraded. Close to a third of the world population is food insecure. Healthy diets are not affordable for 3 billion people. Despite the high levels of food insecurity, food waste is a global problem. An estimated one third of the global food supply is lost or wasted, an average of 74 kg per capita. On another hand, food systems are a major cause of environmental degradation and a driver of climate change. They are considered to be the primary driver of biodiversity loss globally, a major cause [\u2026] Promoting holistic health and wellbeing of pregnant and parenting adolescents  and their children in Africa \u2013 a life course model approach By  joshua Health and Wellbeing Early pregnancy and childbearing significantly disadvantage girls, starting a cycle of social exclusion that significantly harm their and their offspring\u2019s physical, mental, and social well-being. Despite the negative consequences of adolescent childbearing, there is limited evidence on the experiences of pregnant and parenting adolescents in Africa and appropriate interventions to enhance the health and well-being of these adolescents and their children. Taking a life course approach, the Health and Wellbeing Theme seeks to develop a transdisciplinary program of work that will generate rigorous evidence on the health and well-being of pregnant and parenting adolescents and their children. [\u2026] Analysis of supermarket grocery data for prediction of nutritional and health outcomes at population level By  joshua Agnes Kiragga, Maureen Ng\u201detich, Steve Cygu, and Elizabeth Kimani Globally, the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are leading cause of death. The majority of NCDs are driven by changes in lifestyles and diet. Diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases are associated with consumption of high contents of sugar, salt, or oily foods. While undernutrition is still a widespread concern in Africa, nutritional related conditions such as obesity has become a rising epidemic due to urbanization, changes in lifestyle and income growth. Diet is traditionally measured using food and drink consumption, often self-reported. There has been an increase in online tools [\u2026] A systemic approach to program-oriented proposals for maximal impact By  joshua Sheena Kayira and Joshua Muthama While the Localization Agenda for Africa has tremendously advanced, and some donors have shifted to funding African institutions directly, there is still a limitation in leveraging these opportunities. There are notable gaps in developing program-oriented proposals that integrate systems thinking, strategic partnerships, evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) fundamentals, and co-creation for maximal impact. Existing approaches to business development are no longer adequate in meeting the growing and changing needs of research organizations in the sub-Saharan African region. There are a number of prescribed solutions and platforms to facilitate donor prepositioning, streamline processes for proposal development, centralize efforts, [\u2026] Load More Ideas Transforming Lives in Africa Through Research QUICK LINKS About Us What We Do Media Center Careers Resources Policy Briefs Corporate Documents Microdata Portal Whistle Blowing APHRC Headquarters Manga Close, Kirawa Road Nairobi, Kenya.

These issues threaten infrastructure, public health, and economic stability. For example, heatwaves can raise mortality rates among vulnerable populations, while flooding disrupts transportation and spreads disease. In this context, youth are emerging as a powerful force. This year\u2019s World Cities Day, themed \u201cYouth Climate Changemakers: Catalyzing Local Action for Urban Sustainability,\u201d emphasizes young people\u2019s vital role in tackling these challenges and shaping a sustainable future for our cities. Youth at the Forefront of Climate Action: Youth involvement in climate action is essential since they will face the consequences of today\u2019s decisions in the future. Their unique perspectives allow them to foresee long-term impacts and advocate for sustainable solutions. Young people bring fresh ideas and innovative approaches to problem-solving, unbound by traditional thinking. Their innovative spirit fuels the development of new technologies and social movements. By demanding policy changes and mobilizing grassroots efforts, youth are driving systemic change and urging governments and corporations to act. Cities as Climate Actors : Cities contribute significantly to climate change while also suffering its effects. They account for a large portion of global greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, energy, and waste. To combat climate change, cities must embrace sustainable urban planning, invest in renewable energy, and promote green infrastructure. This includes reducing urban sprawl, improving transportation, and enhancing walkability. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Green infrastructure, like green roofs and urban forests, mitigates the urban heat island effect and improves air quality. However, to succeed, cities must engage youth in decision-making processes. By creating youth councils, providing climate education, and supporting youth-led initiatives, cities can empower young people to contribute to sustainable urban development. Collaborative efforts between young people and city governments are essential for fostering innovation and resilience. Psychological Impact of Climate Change on Youth : The climate crisis poses a significant threat to the mental and physical health of young people. As climate-related disasters become more frequent, young people face increased trauma and stress. Anxiety about the future can lead to mental health issues, including depression and eco-anxiety. Traditional education often overlooks the social and emotional dimensions of climate change, leaving students feeling isolated and overwhelmed. To support youth, we need a multifaceted approach that empowers them to take action, fostering a sense of agency. Raising awareness of the mental health impacts of climate change can reduce stigma and encourage young people to seek help. We can equip youth to lead the charge toward a sustainable future by addressing both environmental and psychological challenges. In conclusion, the fate of our cities and planet depends on our response to the climate crisis. With their passion and innovation, youth are at the forefront of this movement. By empowering young people and equipping them with the necessary tools, we can harness their energy to build a sustainable future. As hubs of innovation, cities must collaborate with youth to create resilient, low-carbon environments.

This research was informed by limited evidence of what was working well vis-\u00e0vis what did not work in implementing the Education and Training Sector Gender Policy. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education was keen on using evidence in the gender and education policy review. This research report highlights findings on how the teacher-training curriculum prepares teachers to implement gender-mainstreaming strategies within the basic education sector policies and guidelines. The research reports on the status of gender mainstreaming practices inside the classroom during teaching and learning and how these influence school attendance, choice of subjects, and academic performance.

Thus, existing policies tend to be discriminatory, impractical, or non-inclusive. There is need for capacity strengthening among SRHR researchers in the Anglophone African region to develop research leaders and partners who will drive generation of evidence and institutionalization of innovations to inform policy. Led by APHRC, the World Health Organization Human Reproduction Program (WHO-HRP) Alliance Research and Knowledge Transfer Hub seeks to enable African institutions to generate their own appropriate and contextual solutions to SRHR challenges and adopt them into policy and practice. Specific Objectives To strengthen capacities of individuals to engage effectively in SRHR implementation research, policy process and dissemination of SRHR research output To support institutionalization of tools developed by trained individuals at their home institutions or regions To enhance uptake of research output in policy-making via facilitation of researchers-policymakers interactions and other dissemination efforts Expected outcomes Trained SRHR research leaders capable of driving SRHR research agenda in their respective institutions and countries Strengthened African institutions and countries capable of generating their own appropriate and contextual solutions to SRHR challenges and adopt them into policy and practice Establishment of a high-quality knowledge translation infrastructure capable of providing evidence-informed, relevant and cost-oriented support to policymakers on SRHR issues. Project outputs so far Since inception, the project has built the research capacities of 458 researchers through 16 short courses and workshops on SRHR-related topics. The project has also supported four masters\u2019 students currently working on SRHR topics to complete their master\u2019s projects, published four papers, presented a toolkit on adolescent health at an international conference, and won four grants jointly with partner institutions/hubs. The hub has also conducted six webinars involving Anglophone and Francophone African countries reaching more than 428 individuals.
